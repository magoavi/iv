> Analyse the Italian Fragrance Market

#### Abstract

This report analyses aggregate level data for the fragrance market in Italy. The primary objectives of this
research are as follows:

a) Assess the Price Sensitivity of Each Focal Brand
b) Assess the Communication Impact for Each of the Focal Brands
c) Assess the Competitive Effects
d) Advice on Budget Allocation and Optimisation for the Rest of the Year 2017.

> This research uses regression models created using `Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)` as well as `Instrumental
Variables (IV)`. IV is used to overcome the issue of reverse causality which causes an endogeneity problem in
identifying the impact of the communication variables as well as the price sensitivity of the focal brands.
This study finds that the focal fragrance brands could reduce their prices near their main selling period to realise
higher revenue. Further, fragrances sold in bundles can still face competitive effects due to communication spend
done by competing fragrances sold in the same package.
